 ###  ðŸ’¼ [Final Project : Analyzing Stock Performance and Building a Dashboard](https://github.com/marcelolago61/Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data---IBM-Data-Science)
 


# ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

On this project I'll take on the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst at a newly established investment startup focused on guiding customers in stock investments. My responsibility is to gather financial data, including historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports, by leveraging Python libraries and web scraping techniques. After collecting the data, I will create visualizations and build an interactive dashboard to uncover patterns and trends. The analysis will focus on well-known stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

# ðŸ“ˆ Stock shares

A stock represents ownership in a corporation, giving shareholders a claim to its assets and profits. Shares are the individual units of stock. Investors can buy and sell stocks, profiting if prices rise and losing if they fall. Stock prices depend on factors like outstanding shares and future earnings expectations. Trading occurs throughout the day, and stock tickers provide real-time price updates. In this lab, you will use the yfinance API to retrieve stock ticker data and analyze stock information.
